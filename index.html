    <p>Hi! My name is Lianna Wong. I’m currently a student in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College. Before I started this program, I was previously in the Business Administration program for a year and then got sick of it, simply because I couldn’t see myself not doing a creative job. So far, I’m really enjoying my time in the Media program. Although it’s often challenging, I’m eager to learn new things and improve my work ethic and experience!</p>
As an introduction, I’d like to share some of my hobbies. I like hiking and going on nature walks, collecting trinkets like angels and oddities like teeth, doing nails, and making clothing. I also really enjoy listening to music, such as Yung Lean, The Cure, The Hellp, and Snow Strippers. Recently, I’ve been getting into playing Skate 4 since it recently came out and it’s kind of convincing me to get back into skating at local parks, even if I’m not super good at it. Since this program has a photography program, I picked up a Nikon at the store and I’ve been wanting to explore more into photography as a hobby, and get inspiration from other photographers. Another thing I’m trying to get back into is painting, since it’s just something to do in my free time to keep myself busy and keep my brain somewhat creative.
